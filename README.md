# Image-captioning-and-segmentation-
This project focuses on the integration of Image Captioning and Image Segmentation, two complementary tasks in computer vision.

Image Captioning: Automatically generates descriptive natural language sentences for a given image. It requires combining visual feature extraction (via CNNs or Vision Transformers) with sequence modeling (via RNNs, LSTMs, or Transformer decoders).

Image Segmentation: Identifies and classifies each pixel in an image into predefined categories (e.g., person, car, tree). Models like U-Net, Mask R-CNN, or DeepLab are typically used.


By combining these tasks, interns will gain hands-on experience across:

Computer Vision (object detection, segmentation)

Natural Language Processing (language modeling, text generation)

Deep Learning Architectures (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers)

Multi-task Learning (shared representations for vision and language tasks)

Objectives

1. Learn and implement deep learning techniques for image feature extraction.


2. Develop a caption generation model using encoder-decoder or transformer-based architectures.


3. Train and evaluate image segmentation models on benchmark datasets.


4. Explore synergy between tasks â€“ e.g., using segmentation maps to improve caption accuracy.


5. Deploy or demonstrate the system with real-time image input.
